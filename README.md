### Hello, and welcome to this challenge. 


## This is how this game works: 

- First, the game starts after you click any key, and it chooses a random color out of the four  availble colors, which will fade out and in on your screen.
- Second, you need to memories this color and press it.
- Third, if your answer is correct, the next level will be that you chould press the first color then the second color that the game chooses. And so on until you press a wrong pattern, then you lose and you have to press any key to restart.
